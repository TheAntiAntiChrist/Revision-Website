            <h2>Cracking Hydrocarbons</h2>
            <p>Longer-chain hydrocarbons can be broken down into shorter hydrocarbons (which are more useful) through a process called <strong>cracking</strong>.<br><br>
            During thermal cracking:<br>
            -The hydrocarbons are heated until they vapourise.<br>
            -The vapour is passed over a hot catalyst.<br>
            -A thermal decomposition reaction then takes place.<br>
            -The products include alkanes and alkenes.<br><br>
            During steam cracking, hydrocarbons are mixed with steam and heated to a high temperature. Some of the products of cracking are useful as fuels. There is a high demand for fuels with small chains of carbon atoms because they are easy to ignite and have low boiling points. Alkenes can be used to make a range of new compounds, including polymers and industrial alcohol.</p>
