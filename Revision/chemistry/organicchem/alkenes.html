            <h2>Cracking Hydrocarbons</h2>
            <p>Longer-chain hydrocarbons can be broken down into shorter hydrocarbons (which are more useful) through a process called <strong>cracking</strong>.<br><br>
            During thermal cracking:<br>
            -The hydrocarbons are heated until they vapourise.<br>
            -The vapour is passed over a hot catalyst.<br>
            -A thermal decomposition reaction then takes place.<br>
            -The products include alkanes and alkenes.<br><br>
            During steam cracking, hydrocarbons are mixed with steam and heated to a high temperature. Some of the products of cracking are useful as fuels. There is a high demand for fuels with small chains of carbon atoms because they are easy to ignite and have low boiling points. Alkenes can be used to make a range of new compounds, including polymers and industrial alcohol.</p>
            <h2>Alkenes</h2>
            <p>Unlike alkanes, alkenes can have double bonds between their carbon atoms as well as single bonds. Since they have a double bond, alkenes are described as <strong>unsaturated</strong>.<br>
            The general formula for alkenes is:<br></p>
            <img src="alkene-formula.png">
            <p>The simplest alkene is ethene, which has the formula: <strong>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub></strong><br>
            It is made up of four hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms that share a double bond: (<strong>C=C</strong>).</p>
            <h4>Displayed Formula</h4>
            <p>Alkenes can be drawn using displayed formula:</p>

                <h4 style="margin: 10px;">(Ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)</h4>

            </div>
            <h2>Reactions of Alkenes</h2>
            <p>Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the double carbon bonds. Alkenes can combust with oxygen although they tend to produce more smoke than alkanes due to incomplete combustion.<br>
            Hydrogen can be added to alkenes to produce alkanes. A nickel catalyst is used for the reaction:<br></p>
            <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Ethene + Hydrogen -> Ethane</h4>
            <p>This is an <strong>addition reaction</strong>.</p>
            <p>Ethanol can be produced by reacting ethene with steam in the presence of a catalyst, phosphoric acid:<br></p>
            <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Ethene + Steam -> Ethanol (<strong>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH</strong>)</h4>
            <h2>Bromine Water</h2>
            <p>As alkenes are more reactive than alkanes, they can react with bromine water. This reaction can be used to differentiate between alkenes and alkanes:</p>
            <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Ethene (colourless) + Bromine Water (orange brown) -> Colourless Solution (Alkenes)</h4>
            <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Ethane (colourless) + Bromine Water (orange brown) -> Orange Brown Solution (Alkanes)</h4>
