        	<img src="rateofreac.png" title="The equation for working out the rate of reaction">
        	<p>The rate of reaction is measuring the amount of time it takes for the reactants of an equation to completely react. The rate of reaction is measured in the unit used for mesauring the amount of reactant or product per second (e.g. 32g/s - 32 grams reacted for every second that passes).</p>

        <h2>Collision Theory</h2>
        <div class="info">
        	<p>In chemistry, reactions are explained using the idea of collisions: chemical reactions occur when reacting particles collide with each other provided they have enough energy. The minimum amount of energy required for these particles to start reacting is called the activation energy.</p>
